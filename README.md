1. Tableau Tools Usage:
Tableau is a powerful data visualization tool that allows users to create interactive and shareable dashboards. It provides a user-friendly interface for connecting to various data sources, performing data analysis, and creating visualizations.

2. Dynamic Charts:

Dynamic charts in Tableau refer to visualizations that can be interactively updated and modified by users. This typically involves features like filtering, sorting, and highlighting data dynamically based on user inputs. This allows for a more engaging and personalized exploration of the data.

3. Bubble Charts:

A bubble chart is a type of scatter plot where each data point is represented by a circle (bubble). The position of the bubble on the chart corresponds to its x and y values, and additional information can be encoded using the size of the bubble. This is useful for visualizing three dimensions of data in a two-dimensional space.

4. Columned Bar Charts:

A columned bar chart, also known simply as a bar chart, is a common type of chart used to represent categorical data. In this chart, rectangular bars of varying lengths are used to depict the values associated with different categories. It's effective for comparing the magnitudes of different categories.
